# 🧬 Arcene Dataset - PCA & Classification  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores the **Arcene dataset** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and classification techniques.  
The goal is to handle high-dimensional data effectively by reducing features while maintaining classification accuracy.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset is taken from the **Arcene Benchmark Dataset (UCI ML Repository)**. It contains:  
- Training features and labels  
- Validation set  
- Test set  
- Parameter settings  

Each sample has **10,000 features**, making dimensionality reduction essential.  

---

## ⚙️ Workflow  
- Data loading and inspection  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA  
- Classification model training and evaluation  
- Visualization of explained variance and results  

---

## 📊 Results  
- PCA successfully reduced the feature space  
- Optimal number of components was selected based on explained variance  
- Classification achieved good performance after dimensionality reduction
